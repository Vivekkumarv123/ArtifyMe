      <p>
        At ArtifyMe, we use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your experience on our website. This Cookies Policy explains what cookies are, how we use them, and your choices regarding their use.

      <h2 className="cookiesTitle">What are Cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files stored on your device (computer, tablet, smartphone) when you visit a website. They help the website remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size, and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.
      </p>

      <h2 className="cookiesTitle">First-Party Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        These are cookies set by the website you are visiting. They allow website owners to collect analytics data, remember language settings, and perform other useful functions that help provide a good user experience.
      </p>

      <h2 className="cookiesTitle">Third-Party Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-party cookies to report usage statistics of the site and deliver advertisements on and through the site. These cookies are set by domains other than the one you are visiting. They can track your behavior and send this data to the respective third party.
      </p>

      <h2 className="cookiesTitle">Essential Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Essential cookies are necessary for the website to function properly. They allow you to navigate the site and use its features, such as accessing secure areas or storing items in your shopping cart. These cookies don’t collect any personal information that can be used for marketing or tracking your browsing history.
      </p>

      <h2 className="cookiesTitle">Performance or Analytical Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Performance cookies collect information about how you use a website, such as which pages you visited and which links you clicked on. None of this information can be used to identify you. It is all aggregated and, therefore, anonymized. The purpose of these cookies is to improve website functions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="cookiesTitle">Technical or Preference Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Preference cookies allow a website to remember choices you have made in the past, like what language you prefer, what region you would like weather reports for, or your username and password so you can automatically log in.
      </p>

      <h2 className="cookiesTitle">Behavioural or Advertising Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Advertising cookies are used to personalize the advertising content that you see on a website. These cookies can track your browsing habits, making it possible to show you ads that are relevant to your interests. They can also limit the number of times you see an advertisement and measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.
      </p>

      <h2 className="cookiesTitle">Social Media Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Social media cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or a "like" button on our site, or when you engage with our content on or through a social networking site such as Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. These cookies are set by the respective social media platforms.
